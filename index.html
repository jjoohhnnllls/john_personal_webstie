									<h1>About Me</h1>
								</header>
								<p style="font-style: normal; text-indent: 2em;">I'm John, a Pinoy tech wizard (not the pointy hat kind... mostly) based in Singapore. I spend my days unraveling the digital mysteries behind your favorite apps ‚Äì you know, the ones you can't live without?(tiktok...)ü§î Yeah, I was curious how they worked too, so I dove headfirst into the software engineering and data science rabbit hole üï≥Ô∏è and haven't found the exit (nor do I want to!). My internship at DataExpertSG was like leveling up in a coding game. I built an Email Analyzer app using LLMs like Ollama to basically make emails spill their secrets and turn them into pretty graphs with Python. It was a wild ride of coding and "aha!" moments. üí°
										</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/tech_vibes.png" alt="" /></div>
									<p>Python is my go to programming language, and while I'm not gonna lie, sometimes I "vibe code" with my AI co-pilot (it's like having a super-smart rubber duck ü§ñ), I always make sure my hands get the real coding workout too. My dream? To become a software or AI engineer and sprinkle some AI magic into everyday apps to make life a little less "ugh" and a lot more "ooh la la!" ‚ú® When I'm not battling bugs üêõ, you can catch me on the basketball court (swish!) üèÄ or lost in my headphones üéß. Fun fact: I used to make music before I started making code. And yeah, sometimes I have existential thoughts about AI taking over my job... or at least becoming my ultimate coding buddy . üò¨ Scary? Maybe a little. Awesome? Definitely! üòé</p>

														<p style="margin: 0;"><b>Information Technology Intern @ DataExpert (Feb 2025 - May 2025)</b></p>
														<p>The highlight of this internship was definitely building my own Email Analyzer tool for digital forensic investigators. This project was a research and development kind and a proof of concept. It was a Python-based project where I used large language models (LLMs) hosted by Ollama locally to help summarize email content automatically. Instead of going through emails one by one, investigators could get a full report generated by AI and gain insights about the emails with the different visualisations ‚Äîand even chat with it to ask questions about the emails, like a mini custom ChatGPT. I spent a lot of time on coding  prompting, researching email formats, integrating AI, and testing across different platforms. Honestly, it felt like I got to be an AI engineer for a while!</p>
														<p>Outside of that, I learned a lot about secure data destruction. I used different tools to wipe and clone disks, and was involved and in-charged in jobs that required removing hard drives from servers in data centers, scanning them, and then physically destroying them so the data couldn‚Äôt be recovered. Some jobs involved over 500 drives‚Äîdefinitely a workout!</p>
														<p>I also tore down laptops to extract SSDs, helped present a digital forensic tool to customers, and set up a desktop PC to act as a file server with network sharing. Plus, I did tons of documentation: technical write-ups, how-to guides, and notes for future developers.</p>
														<P>This internship was a mix of hands-on tech, research, operations, and real-world problem solving. It was an amazing opportunity.</P>

														<p style="margin: 0;"><b>Information Technology Intern @ Konverge Technologies (May 2023 - Sep 2023)</b></p>
														<p>I gained hands-on experience troubleshooting Windows hardware, software, and network issues, significantly enhancing user productivity. I've contributed to IT infrastructure deployment and user onboarding, including support for remote and offshore teams. My work has included resolving domain, network, and Active Directory issues, leading to improved system stability. I've also gained valuable exposure to enterprise network environments, including fiber optics, device configuration, and server room operations.</p>															
														<P> While working on offshore vessels, I deployed and maintained IT equipment to ensure full operational readiness. I thrive in dynamic IT settings, often stepping into multiple roles to manage a wide range of technical challenges. Additionally, I've helped streamline IT operations by implementing process improvements that reduced resolution times and increased efficiency.</P>
